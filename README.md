# 1- add
 Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers.<br>
 Example
 <br>
 - For **param1 = 1** and **param1 = 1**, the output should be
**solution(param1, param2) = 3.**
**input** two integers 
Guaranteed constraints:
**-1000 ≤ param1,param2 ≤ 1000.**
**output** a integer The sum of the two inputs.

My solution
```
def solution(param1, param2):
    return param1 + param2
```
# 2- centuryFromYear
- Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.
Example 
- For year = 1905, the output should be **solution(year) = 20 **
- For year = 1700, the output should be **solution(year) = 17.**

**Input**
A positive integer, designating the year.

Guaranteed constraints:
**1 ≤ year ≤ 2005.**

**output** a integer

The number of the century the year is in.
My solution

```
import math

def solution(year):
    return(math.ceil(year / 100))

```
